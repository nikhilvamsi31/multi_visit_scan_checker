# multi_visit_scan_checker
# This is the code for the longitudinal scan checker that will soon be launched on the Central Nueroimaging Data Archive, hosted by the Neuroinformatics Research Group at Washington University in St. Louis. The longitudinal scan checker allows investigators on the CNDA to ensure the reliability of scan data by running a similarity algorithm on individual subjects. This checks for the similarity between scans.
